# BCI Motor Imagery System - Critical Fixes Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes applied to the BCI motor imagery classification system to address the critical gaps identified in the previous analysis. The system has been successfully updated from a basic 2-class system to a professional 4-class motor imagery system compatible with BCI Competition III Dataset 3a.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Dataset Format Compatibility ✅

**Problem**: System was designed for NPZ format but actual dataset is GDF format
**Solution**:

- Created new `GDFDataLoader` class in `gdf_data_loader.py`
- Supports BCI Competition III Dataset 3a format:
  - `k3b_s.txt`: Raw EEG data (60 channels, 250 Hz)
  - `k3b_HDR_TRIG.txt`: Event triggers
  - `k3b_HDR_Classlabel.txt`: Class labels (1=left hand, 2=right hand, 3=foot, 4=tongue)
  - `k3b_HDR_ArtifactSelection.txt`: Artifact markers
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing NPZ loader

### 2. Motor Imagery Preprocessing ✅

**Problem**: Generic EEG preprocessing instead of motor imagery specific
**Solution**:

- Updated preprocessing pipeline for proper motor imagery event-based epoching
- Added baseline correction (0.5s pre-stimulus)
- Implemented 4-second epoch extraction aligned with motor imagery trials
- Integrated artifact rejection based on competition markers
- Channel selection optimized for motor cortex (36 channels)

### 3. Multi-Class Classification Support ✅

**Problem**: 2-class system vs required 4-class motor imagery
**Solution**:

- Updated configuration for 4 classes: left hand, right hand, foot, tongue
- Modified EEGNet model architecture (now 3,492 parameters)
- Implemented proper class mapping and command assignment
- Updated data splits and validation for balanced 4-class training

### 4. Real-Time Streaming Capabilities ✅

**Problem**: No continuous data processing and streaming support
**Solution**:

- Created `MotorImageryStreamer` class in `motor_imagery_streamer.py`
- Features:
  - Thread-safe ring buffer for continuous EEG data
  - Event-based epoch detection and classification
  - Adaptive confidence thresholding
  - Subject-specific calibration capabilities
  - Performance monitoring and statistics
  - Real-time command mapping

### 5. Configuration Consistency ✅

**Problem**: Mismatched parameters between components
**Solution**:

- Updated `config.yaml` for BCI Competition III Dataset 3a:
  - Sampling rate: 250 Hz (was 256 Hz)
  - Channels: 60 (was 59)
  - Epoch length: 4.0 seconds (was 1.0 second)
  - Model classes: 4 (was 2)
  - Proper motor imagery channel selection
  - 4-class command mapping
