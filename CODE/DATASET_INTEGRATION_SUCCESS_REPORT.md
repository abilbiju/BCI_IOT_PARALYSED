  - Tongue: 296 epochs

### Combined Dataset Benefits

- **Massive Data Increase**: From 240 to 584 base epochs (2.4x)
- **With Augmentation**: 1,224 training epochs (5x original)
- **Better Generalization**: Reduced overfitting significantly
- **Multi-Subject Robustness**: 9 different subjects' data

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Event Code Standardization

```python
# Flexible event mapping handles multiple formats
motor_imagery_codes = [769, 770, 771, 772]  # Standard BCI IV 2a
alternative_codes = [1, 2, 3, 4]             # Simple encoding
# Automatic conversion: event_type + 768 or event_type - 1
```

### 2. Channel Standardization

```python
# Unified 22-channel processing for both datasets
target_channels = 22  # EEG channels from BCI IV 2a
# BCI III 3a: Select motor cortex subset
# BCI IV 2a: Use native 22 EEG channels
```

### 3. Enhanced Data Augmentation

```python
# Multi-round augmentation with varying parameters
augmentation_techniques = [
    "Gaussian noise (varying levels)",
    "Time shifting (Â±60ms)",
    "Amplitude scaling (0.85-1.15x)",
    "Channel dropout (1-3 channels)",
    "Temporal smoothing (Gaussian filter)"
]
```
